# 🏗 Scaffold-DOT


🧪 An open-source, up-to-date toolkit for building decentralized applications (dapps) on Polkadot Hub blockchain with Solidity smart contracts. It's designed to make it easier for developers to create and deploy smart contracts and build user interfaces that interact with those contracts.

⚙️ Built using NextJS, Reown AppKit, Hardhat, Wagmi, Viem, and Typescript.

- ✅ **Contract Hot Reload**: Your frontend auto-adapts to your smart contract as you edit it.
- 🪝 **[Custom hooks](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/hooks/)**: Collection of React hooks wrapper around [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) to simplify interactions with smart contracts with typescript autocompletion.
- 🧱 [**Components**](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/components/): Collection of common web3 components to quickly build your frontend.
- 🔥 **Burner Wallet & Local Faucet**: Quickly test your application with a burner wallet and local faucet.
- 🔐 **Integration with Wallet Providers**: Connect to different wallet providers and interact with the Ethereum network.

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v20.18.3)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [Polkadot-SDK](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/parachains/install-polkadot-sdk/)

## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold-DOT, follow the steps below:

1. Install the latest version of Scaffold-DOT, with Polkadot-SDK submodule.

```
git clone https://github.com/scaffold-dot/scaffold-dot.git scaffold-dot
```
cd into scaffold-dot directory and yarn install

```
cd scaffold-dot && yarn install
```

This step will set up your monorepo and download the correct prebuilt asset hub binaries for your system.



2. On a terminal, start the substrate node:

```
yarn chain
```

3. On a second terminal, start the eth-rpc server:

```
yarn rpc
```

4. On a third terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local chain.


5. On a fourth terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.


**Deployment to a public testnet or AssetHub**

6. Generate a deployment private key by running `yarn generate`, and follow the prompts. `yarn account` will print account details to the terminal. Fund your account with the [Polkadot faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/?parachain=1111) or send the deployment account somd funds from AssetHub.
